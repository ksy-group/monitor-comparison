# monitor-comparison

Have you ever wonder which monitor to choose from two different monitor ratio such as 16:9 and 21:9?

Let's say you already own 24 inch 16:9 monitor and you want to buy 21:9 ultrawide monitor, you want to have the height of both monitors to have at least around the same size. What size should you use for Ultrawide Monitor for 24 inch monitor?

>This **monitor-comparison** is used to compare monitor 16:9 (normal), 21:9 (ultrawide) to have the same height size feature.
